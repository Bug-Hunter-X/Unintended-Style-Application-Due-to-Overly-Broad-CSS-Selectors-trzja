This repository demonstrates an uncommon CSS bug involving overly broad selectors. The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version. The issue arises from using selectors that are too general, leading to unintended styling across multiple elements.  The solution focuses on using more specific selectors to target only the intended elements, improving code maintainability and predictability.
