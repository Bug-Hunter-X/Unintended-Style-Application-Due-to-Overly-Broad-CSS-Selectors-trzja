To solve this, use more specific selectors. Instead of targeting all paragraphs with `p`, target only the specific paragraphs that require the unique styling using more specific selectors, possibly involving classes or IDs.  Example:

/* Incorrect (too broad): */
p {
  color: red;
}

/* Correct (more specific): */
.error-message {
  color: red;
}

/* Correct (using an ID): */
#specificParagraph {
  color: red;
}

This approach ensures that styling is applied only where intended, preventing unexpected visual issues.
